# 📈 SeqMaster

SeqMaster is an application  designed to calculate and visualize mathematical sequences using graphs.

(No source code at the moment.)
# 🚀 Features

1. ### Calculate Explicit Sequences

In the form of : *n + x*

2. ### Calculate Recursive Sequences

(Before you enter the first term U0)

In the form of : *Un + x*

2. ### Infinite or Custom range ?

You can choose between a __custom__ range and an __infinite__ range. To enable the infinite range set both *Minimum* and *Maximum* range to 0

⚠️ If you have a large limited range, it is better to use the infinite range (optimization reasons)

3. ### Export Picture

The graph can be exported as a PNG or JPEG image.

4. ### Import / Export your data

- formula, graph customizations and range can be saved as a JSON file.

- Export to a CSV file and use with Excel or other applications

- Import a CSV file to view the graph
